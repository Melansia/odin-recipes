Yet another tutorial from the tutorial hell.

Another attempt to get the HTML and CSS basics, hope this time info will stick.

Objectives:

- [x] Make a super simple html page
- [x] Add some links and photos to it
- [X] Upload all this to git
- [ ] **Hope** to achieve some knowledge

- [x] Added styles.css with minimum touches


Starting to work with css, getting some understating on how css work, still positioning of the elements on the page and project structure gives me hard time. Learned about box model as well as block and inline elements.
